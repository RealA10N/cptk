## [0.1.0a3] - 28.2.2022

### Fixed

- Default configurations and project structures are now bundled with the wheel
  release.
  - This resolves an `UNEXPECTED ERROR` when trying to run the `cptk init`
    subcommand for wheel installs (including ones provided by `pip` from PyPI).

## [0.1.0a2] - 26.2.2022

This alpha release adds the `cptk test` subcommand to cptk! ðŸ¥³

Starting from this release the project configuration files supports a new
field called `test`. It will be automatically created for you when you
initialize a new cptk project using `cptk init`, and using it cptk will know
where to store the scraped sample tests when cloning problems.

By default, running `cptk test` will try and run the tests for the last problem
that is known to cptk. It is also easy to add your custom test cases that will
run when executing `cptk test`: just add `.in` and `.out` text files to the
problem's testing folder!

For more information and a full tutorial on the `cptk test` subcommand,
you are more than welcome to visit our [wiki page](https://github.com/RealA10N/cptk/wiki).
